            <li><strong>ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation)</strong>: Established in 1969, ISRO is India's national space agency, known for its cost-effective space missions and significant contributions to space research.</li>
            <li><strong>Aryabhata</strong>: Launched on April 19, 1975, Aryabhata was India's first satellite, marking the country's entry into space exploration.</li>
            <li><strong>Chandrayaan-1</strong>: Launched in 2008, Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar probe. It made a significant discovery by confirming the presence of water molecules on the Moon's surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Mangalyaan (Mars Orbiter Mission)</strong>: Launched on November 5, 2013, Mangalyaan made India the first country to reach Mars on its first attempt and the fourth space agency to do so. It was also one of the most cost-effective Mars missions.</li>
            <li><strong>Chandrayaan-2</strong>: Launched in July 2019, Chandrayaan-2 was India's second lunar exploration mission. Although its lander, Vikram, didn't succeed in a soft landing, the orbiter continues to function, sending valuable data.</li>
            <li><strong>Chandrayaan-3</strong>: Launched on July 14, 2023, Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed on the Moon on August 23, 2023, making India the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the lunar surface. It also marked India's first successful landing attempt after Chandrayaan-2's partial failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaganyaan Mission</strong>: ISRO is working on the Gaganyaan mission, which aims to send Indian astronauts, known as Gagannauts, into space. It will be India's first crewed space mission.</li>
            <li><strong>PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle)</strong>: PSLV is known as ISRO's workhorse. It has launched numerous satellites, including India's first interplanetary mission to Mars and several commercial satellites for other countries.</li>
            <li><strong>NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation)</strong>: India's indigenous navigation system, similar to GPS, is known as NavIC. It provides accurate position information services over India and the surrounding region.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Applications</strong>: India uses space technology for various applications, including communication, weather forecasting, disaster management, agriculture, and education. ISRO's satellites play a crucial role in these areas.</li>
            <li><strong>International Collaboration</strong>: ISRO collaborates with various international space agencies, including NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos). India has also launched satellites for over 30 countries.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Missions</strong>: ISRO has several ambitious projects in the pipeline, including missions to study the Sun (Aditya-L1), a second mission to Mars (Mangalyaan-2), and missions to Venus and asteroids.</li>
